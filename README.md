To develop and implement machine learning algorithms that leverage healthcare data to accurately predict the risk of developing specific chronic diseases in individuals. The goal is to create a predictive model capable of identifying high-risk individuals early in the disease trajectory, enabling more effective prevention and intervention strategies to reduce the burden of chronic diseases on healthcare systems and improve overall accuracy rate.
